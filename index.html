									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Analyst-Chukwu/BA-Customers-Experience-Analysis">Analysis of British airways<br />
									customers' reviews using python, and SQL Server</a></h2>
									<p>The nagging question for BA is how to stay above the competition curve? British Airways has been in Business for 50 years (1974 to current). Over these years more than 1000 airlines have sprung up and are in operation. Within these numbers, 
										more than 30 airlines are major global carriers and are in direct competition with BA. 
										BA, like every businesses understands that customers are king. Even though BA leadership might 
										believe they have good products and services, do their customers feel same way?<br/>
									</p>For BA to remain above the competition curve, they must understand their customers' sentiment towards them.
									In this project, therefore, I employed NLTK in python to extract customers' sentiment scores (Positive, Neutral, Negative) to understand BA customers' loyalty towards the airline. 
									I also employed Topic modelling to generate topics that summarizes BA customers' feelings and attitude towards the brand using BERTopic model, still in python.
									Data Cleaning was then carried out in SQL Server, where Exploratory Data Analysis was also done. The data findings were then visiualized in Power BI</p><br>
									<p></p>What then does this data reveal, would BA shutdown soon, or should they fire their CEO? Read to find out.

										Project in SQL Server</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Analyst-Chukwu/Anime/blob/main/Anime.sql" class="image fit"><img src="images/Anime.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>How do you recommend Anime to a friend? This friend likes Anime, but is confused which ones to go for since there are millions of Anime out there. Or how do I, a lover of Anime, convince a friend that Anime is the best art of 
										entertainment even before the creation of the first man?
										Vey Simple. Present a cleaned lists of Anime based on its popularity among viewers. Also its genres, and which demographs loves it the most: Young men or women, Older men or women.
									</p>In this project, I showcased my expertise in data wrangling skills. Deploying advanced data cleaning functions and statements in SQL. I transformed messy Anime dataset sourced from kaggle to present a cleaned viewer's delight.
								</p> So which Anime would you love to watch first? I will recommend Anime in the number 15 index list. You will love it. Click the link to discover the title.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/Analyst-Chukwu/Quantium-Customer-Chip-Purchase-Analysis">Exploration of Customers' Purchasing Behaviour using SQL Server<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Analyst-Chukwu/Quantium-Customer-Chip-Purchase-Analysis" class="image fit"><img src="images/Chips1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									</p>Do you know you can woo your man or woman just with the right choice of chips? Sounds crazy right? But I kid you not. Everybody loves chips. Or you want to see your granny smile like a child? Just buy them chips. Chips are one of the most popular snack items in supermarkets. What do you think is the reason? You think it is for children only? lol. 
									    Exploration of this dataset uncovered a shocking revealation into customer purchasing behavior, and how it is not who you think are the key drivers of chip purchases. This data uncovers the types of customers who buy chips, and how their purchase behavior affect overall sales performance. 
									    By analyzing these patterns, we can uncover insights to understand who then purchases chips the most, if not children.
									<p>In this Project, I analyzed a retail supermarket chips sales data understanding their customers purchasing trends and behaviours. I then visiualized the data insights in Power Bi, offering recommendations backed by data on how to maximize these trends for improved business profitability.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Analyst-Chukwu/Social-Buzz-Project" class="image fit"><img src="images/social media.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Social Buzz Media Company has over 100,000 posts per day, 36,500,000 pieces of content per year! It becomes increasingly necessary that they need to capitalize on the huge amount of data and activities going on their platform, but how?
										<p>In this project, I, therefore, analyzed  the company's top 5 most popular categories of content, and further provided other useful business insights from their data. The data findings were then loaded into Power Bi for data visiualization.
